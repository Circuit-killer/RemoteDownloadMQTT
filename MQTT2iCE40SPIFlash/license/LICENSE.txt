/*
    windbond_serial_debug.cpp 
    A simple program for the Arduino IDE to help familiarize you with
    using WinBond flash memory; can also be used to download the entire
    contents of a flash chip to a file via a serial port interface.
    
    Important bits of the code: the low-level flash functions (which 
    implement the timing diagrams in the datasheet), and a simple 
    serial-port command interface that allows you to talk to your 
    UNO with any generic terminal application (even the command line).

Revisions:
    rev 2 - 21-SEP-2014.
    User 'fiaskow' pointed out that driving the WEL instruction after
    program and erase w/o waiting for the op to finish may be corrupting
    execution. Removed this code (also not needed b/c the WEL is already
    cleared after page write or chip erase).
